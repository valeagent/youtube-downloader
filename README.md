## Common Issues and Solutions

### Download Failures

1. **Outdated yt-dlp**:
   - If you see errors about "This video is unavailable" or "Video unavailable", your yt-dlp version might be outdated
   - Solution: Run `pip install --upgrade yt-dlp` in your virtual environment

2. **Expired Cookies**:
   - YouTube cookies typically expire after 24 hours
   - If downloads start failing after working previously, try:
     1. Get fresh cookies using the "Get cookies.txt" extension
     2. Paste the new cookies into the application
     3. Click "Save Cookies"
     4. Try downloading again

3. **Age-Restricted Videos**:
   - Some videos require cookies even if they're not marked as private
   - Always try using cookies if a download fails

4. **FFmpeg Issues**:
   - If you see errors about "ffmpeg not found", ensure FFmpeg is:
     1. Installed correctly
     2. Added to your system PATH
     3. Restart the application after installing FFmpeg

### Error Messages

- **"Video unavailable"**: Usually means the video is private, deleted, or region-locked
- **"Sign in to confirm your age"**: Requires fresh cookies
- **"ffmpeg not found"**: FFmpeg is not installed or not in PATH
- **"yt-dlp error"**: Usually means yt-dlp needs to be updated

## Troubleshooting

- **FFmpeg not found**: Ensure FFmpeg is installed and in your system PATH
- **Download fails**: 
  1. Check your internet connection
  2. Try using fresh cookies
  3. Update yt-dlp
  4. Check if the video is still available
- **Python not found**: Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed and in your system PATH
- **Cookies not working**: Get fresh cookies from the Chrome extension
- **User Agent Issues**: If downloads fail, try updating your user agent by running `setup_user_agent.bat` (Windows) or `./setup_user_agent.sh` (Linux/Mac)
