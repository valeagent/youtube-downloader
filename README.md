## Common Issues and Solutions

Shorts are difficult and almost impossible to download :/
one way is to go from a link like this: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SXHMnicI6Pg
to https://www.youtube.com/watch/SXHMnicI6Pg and then gett he link - but the format might not be 9:16. If you really need shorts integration ask me.

### Download Failures

1. **Outdated yt-dlp**:
   - If you see errors about "This video is unavailable" or "Video unavailable", your yt-dlp version might be outdated
   - Solution: Run `pip install --upgrade yt-dlp` in your virtual environment

2. **Expired Cookies**:
   - YouTube cookies typically expire after 24 hours
   - If downloads start failing after working previously, try:
     1. Get fresh cookies using the "Get cookies.txt" extension
     2. Paste the new cookies into the application
     3. Click "Save Cookies"
     4. Try downloading again

3. **FFmpeg Issues**:
   - If you see errors about "ffmpeg not found", ensure FFmpeg is:
     1. Installed correctly
     2. Added to your system PATH
     3. Restart the application after installing FFmpeg
### Troubleshooting
- **Python not found**: Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed and in your system PATH
- **Cookies not working**: Get fresh cookies from the Chrome extension
- **User Agent Issues**: If downloads fail, try updating your user agent by running `setup_user_agent.bat` (Windows) or `./setup_user_agent.sh` (Linux/Mac) again
